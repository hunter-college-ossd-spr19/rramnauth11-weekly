This week, we started searching for potential open source projects to contribute to. I found many exciting projects. [CodeTriage.com](CodeTriage.com) was a useful site that allowed me to explore projects based on language and difficulty. Some of those projects were [Pencil](https://github.com/pencil2d/pencil/tree/master/tests/src)  and [Clickhouse](https://github.com/yandex/clickhouse). I liked these projecs because they were mostly written in C++, which I am the most comfortable with, and they contained licenses, READMEs, contributing files,some documentation and a fairly active community. However, I ultimately decided to work in the Open Source NYC project. I want to work on this project because it will help me to not only to become a better programmer and finally use languages other than C++ for a school project, it it will help me to learn to work and communicate effectivly with a team. For such a project, possible roles for me could be writing documentation, being a maintainer, and even developing the web interface. 

This week, Christos Bacharakis was a guest speaker who shared his experience with open source and why he is so passionate about it. He shared many of Mozilla'a projects that are open source and introduced tools that can help us find open source projects and network with others in the open source community.
