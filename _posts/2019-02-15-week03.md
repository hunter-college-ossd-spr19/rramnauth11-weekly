**What things do you feel you need to learn the most to be able to contribute to open source projects?**

To be able to contribute to open source projects, I feel I need to learn how to work can communicate with a large group or team and learn how to pick a project that I can commit to. Sometimes working in a large group can be quite intimidating. A project can have people of different levels of ability and experience. Some of these projects use multiple languages and new technologies that I may be unfamiliar with. Some of these projects are constantly being modified. In this week’s activity, we evaluated projects to determine whether they were a good choice to make a contribution to. I noticed that these projects can have hundreds of contributors and have hundreds or thousands of issues reported, pull requests made, commits in a matter or hours. Learning how to find a good project, one that uses the right balance of technologies I know and don’t know, and being to work fast to keep up with the progress of a project are all qualities I need to contribute to open source. 

**What are the weak points that you want to strength?**

Some weak points I want to strengthen are communicating my ideas both verbally and in writing. Working in large groups, I find it hard to convery things I want to say. I also struggle to explain things in writing, which is an important in open source projects, especially in writing documentation,README files, or even reporting issues.
