**Licensing and Starting our Semester Projects!**

  This week we explored licensing, what protections they provide to those issue them to protect their work, and what freedoms the public has to use this work. Kevin Fleming gave a talk about licensing with Bob's ketchup algorithm. Bob's algorithm computes the right amount of ketchup needed to get the maximum flavor experience when eating french fries. Flemming gaves his audience many scenarios of when Bob's code, posted on the bulletin board, can be used. Copyright law controls to create copies of creative work. Without a license, Bob's code could not be copied in any way. However, it could be discussed by those who read his code and the could could be executed on anyone's computer. Providing a license, however, could grant freedom to copy and use the code for whatever reason they wish. The license would also give Bob the recoginition of being the author of the code if any modification was made.

This week, we formed out groups for the semester project. Working from scratch, we have to organize ourself a groups with clear defined roles. 
Some issues that need to be be addressed it setting up the repository with a ReadMe, License, and Code_of_Conduct files and deciding what technologies to use what environments to set up.
