  This week in class, we were introduced to Git and completed an activity using basic commands. I really wish I learned how to 
use it earlier. It made working on projects easier, and keeps me organized in tracking my project files and changed I make. 
I’m now using Git on all my projects.
  My first contribution would be  writing to and updating documentation. To me, documenting is an important part of the software 
development process. Documentation helps programmers understand what the goal of the project and allows contributors to 
understand the project’s status and what needs to be done. Also, testing and finding bugs is another great first contribution. 
From my own experience, it can be hard to find bugs alone, and having someone else review your code helps to fix errors 
faster.
  I have no preference on what type of project I would work on. I would like to work on something I think is useful, has a 
clear, defined goal and in a language I am familiar with, like C++ or python. My overall goal is to be able to contribute to
large projects.
